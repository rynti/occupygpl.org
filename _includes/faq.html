            <question>Q: I don’t want others to close my code!</question>
            <answer>
                A: They can’t, your code still is open source. What did they close then? THEIR work
                which just happens to be based on your open source code. If you don’t like this, then your
                existing license may be a good fit after all.

            <question>Q: What happens if they write a wrapper around my lib and sell it for $10.000?</question>
            <answer>
                A: Yes, that could happen but it’s also a rather unlikely scenario. If all they’ve done
                is a thin wrapper then you or someone else in the open source community is also capable
                of creating such a thin wrapper in no time. Then all you need to do is undercut them
                by $10.000 and a good chunk of freedom.<br/>
                <br/>
                The more likely scenario is that a company takes your code and produces a large amount
                of other code that just happens to use your lib at its core. The said company will sell
                their code and their extensions for a large sum of money and they are perfectly entitled
                to do so. It’s after all THEIR code.<br/>
                <br/>
                Even this scenario is beneficial to you. Said company will likely find bugs and fix them.

            <question>Q: Open source projects can’t live without the restrictions the GPL offers!</question>
            <answer>
                A: This is not a question, and furthermore it’s not true! There’s a wide variety of
                popular open source projects that use permissive licenses: Clang, LLVM, Node.js, jQuery,
                just to name a few.

            <question>Q: What’s with the name? "Occupy GPL", do you want to destroy the GPL? And all GPL projects?</question>
            <answer>
                A: No, even though it may sound like it (Especially thanks to the old really misleading
                subtitle). The name was chosen because it’s very aggressive and generates a lot of
                attention. The GPL isn’t as good a license as many believe and it really shouldn’t be used
                as much as it is today in open source software. Thats an opinion. There is lots of
                cool software licensed under the GPL that is used by many people every day: Linux, Git, Blender
                and a lot more. Kudos to all these awesome folks!

            <question>Q: You clearly have no idea what free software is about.</question>
            <answer>
                A: Maybe, but I’m more interested in open source software anyway (The FSF makes a distinction here).
                I’m also not interested in politics. Just technology and how to improve it.<br/>
                A nice quote from Linus Torvalds:<br/>
                <br/>
                <quote>
                    "That’s the point of open source – the ability to make the code better for your
                    particular needs, whoever the ‘your’ in question happens to be."

            <question>Q: What about the LGPL? It seems to fit your problem.</question>
            <answer>
                A: Although the LGPL is a huge improvement over the GPL and somewhat solves a lot of
                the problems mentioned above, it’s also way more complicated to use than a permissive
                license and you still have the risk of commiting copyright infringement just by using
                the project the wrong way.

            <question>Q: Isn’t this a bit too aggressive? This site and all? GPL is cool, please don’t hate it.</question>
            <answer>
                A: Yes, it’s aggressive, but that was the intention ;) There’s a misconception
                out there that GPL would be the right choice for almost every open source project
                out there, and it requires the attention of the community in order to bust this
                myth. If you’re happy with everything as it is now, cool - have a nice day then!
                If, however, you notice a problem in a post like

            <question>Q: What is the purpose of this site?</question>
            <answer>
                A: This site attempts to encourage the usage of permissive open source
                licenses and raise awareness that the GPL isn’t the appropriate license
                for every open source project.

                A: Cool. Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/occupygpl/occupygpl.org">fork this
                page</a>. You can even relicense it under GPL terms if you want to, it’s MIT licensed after all.
